# v0.10.0: google pubsub, amazon cloudwatch, percentile aggregators and spool name fix (finally!). Apr 2 2018

## new routes:
* google pubsub #256
* amazon cloudwatch #261, #266

# v0.9.4: Release O'Time. Dec 15, 2017

various network setting fixes  351f807168c8185a8712f7ca5bd9ea6cff020d3e , #243
make windows builds work #245
Add tmpfiles.d config for centos/7 #235

show target address for GrafanaNet routes #244

# v0.9.3: massive aggregator improvements. Oct 19, 2017

## aggregators
* massive aggregation improvements. they now run faster (sometimes by 20x), use less memory and can handle much more load. see #227 , #230
* add derive (rate) aggregator #230
* aggregator regex cache, which lowers cpu usage and increases the max workload, in exchange for a bit more ram usage. #227 By default, the cache is enabled for aggregators set up via commands (init commands in the config) but disabled for aggregators configured via config sections (due to a limitation in our config library)

## docs
* add dashboard explanation screenshot #208

## packaging and versioning

* fix logging on cent6/amzn/el6 #224 43b265d267f27c7090f15c21ff356fee1da48734
* Fix the creation of `/var/run/carbon-relay-ng` directory #213
* `version` argument to get the version

## other
* disable http2.0 support for grafanaNet route, since an incompatibility with nginx was resulting in bogus `400 Bad Request` responses. **note** this fix does not properly work, use 0.9.3-1 instead.
* track allocated memory

# v0.9.2: non-blocking mode, better monitoring. Sep 14, 2017

* make blocking behavior configurable for kafkaMdm and grafanaNet routes.  previously, grafanaNet was blocking, kafkaMdm was non-blocking.  Now both default to non-blocking, but you can specify `blocking=true`.
  - nonblocking (default): when the route's buffer fills up, data will be discarded for that route, but everything else (e.g. other routes) will be unaffected. If you set your buffers large enough this won't be an issue.
rule of thumb: rate in metrics/s times how many seconds you want to be able to buffer in case of downstream issues. memory used will be `bufSize * 100B` or use `bufSize * 150B` to be extra safe.
  - blocking: when the route's buffer fills up, ingestion into the route will slow down/block, providing backpressure to the clients, and also blocking other routes from making progress. use this only if you know what you're doing and have smart clients that can gracefully handle the backpressure
* monitor queue drops for non-blocking queues
* [document route options better](https://github.com/graphite-ng/carbon-relay-ng/blob/master/docs/routes.md)
* monitor queue size and ram used #218
* preliminary support for parsing out the new graphite tag format (kafkaMdm and grafanaNet route only)

the included, dashboard is updated accordingly. and also on https://grafana.com/dashboards/338

# v0.9.1: more tuneables for destinations. Aug 16, 2017

these new settings were previously hardcoded (to the values that are now the defaults):
```
connbuf=<int>                 connection buffer (how many metrics can be queued, not written into network conn). default 30k
iobuf=<int>                   buffered io connection buffer in bytes. default: 2M
spoolbuf=<int>                num of metrics to buffer across disk-write stalls. practically, tune this to number of metrics in a second. default: 10000
spoolmaxbytesperfile=<int>    max filesize for spool files. default: 200MiB (200 * 1024 * 1024)
spoolsyncevery=<int>          sync spool to disk every this many metrics. default: 10000
spoolsyncperiod=<int>         sync spool to disk every this many milliseconds. default 1000
spoolsleep=<int>              sleep this many microseconds(!) in between ingests from bulkdata/redo buffers into spool. default 500
unspoolsleep=<int>            sleep this many microseconds(!) in between reads from the spool, when replaying spooled data. default 10
```

# v0.9.0: some fixes (requires config change). Jul 6, 2017

* unrouteable messages should be debug not notice #198
* rewrite before aggregator; fix race condition, sometimes incorrect aggregations and occasional panics #199
* config parsing fix #175
* kafka-mdm: support multiple brokers. fix #195
* bugfix: make init section work again. fix #201
**attention init section must be changed** from:
```
init = ...
```
to:
```
[init]
cmds = ...
```

note : this was previously released as 0.8.9 but the breaking config change warrants a major version bump.

# v0.8: Growing up a little. Dec 21, 2016

- build packages for ubuntu, debian, centos and automatically push to circleCI upon successfull builds (https://github.com/graphite-ng/carbon-relay-ng#installation)
- add pickle input (#140)
- publish [dashboard on grafana.net](https://grafana.net/dashboards/338)
- fix build for go <1.6 (#118)
- allow overriding docker commandline (#124)
- validation: tuneable validation of metrics2.0 messages. switch default legacy validation to medium, strict was too strict for many. show validation level in UI. Add time-order validation on a per-key basis
- support rewriting of metrics
- document limitations
- grafana.net route updates and doc updates
- re-organize code into modules
- various small improvements
- remove seamless restart stuff.  not sure anymore if it still worked, especially now that we have two listeners.  we didn't maintain it well, and no-one seems to care

**known issues**:
there's some open tickets on github for various smaller issues, but one thing that has been impacting people a lot for a long time now is memory usage growing indefinitely when instrumentation is not configured (because it keeps accumulating internal metrics).
The solution is to configure `graphite_addr` to an address it can send metrics to (e.g. its own input address)
see [ticket 50](https://github.com/graphite-ng/carbon-relay-ng/issues/50) for more info

# v0.7: 200 stars. May 23, 2016

- support more management functionality in admin UI + show dest online status
- properly set default endpoint settings
- configurable maxprocs setting
- consistent hashing (functions same as in official carbon but without replication >1)
- pidfile support
- include example init file & dockerfile
- switch to govendor for native vendoring && update some dependencies
- UDP listener
- pull in js libraries over https
- make validation configurable
- update included dashboard for grafana3
- rate controls for profiling
- experimental new grafana.net hosted metrics route
- refactored imperatives (commands) parsing
- fix versioning when building packages

# v0.6: overhauled codebase, non-blocking operations, more solid. May 3, 2015

- lots of code refactoring.  non-blocking operations
- new config format with imperative commands
- extensive internal stats & grafana dashboard
- a more extensive routing system (which can support round robin & hashing) (see #23)
- aggregators
- use party tool for vendoring dependencies
- metric validator with json endpoint for inspection
- performance fixes

probably more. (was blacklists new?)
note: the admin interfaces need more work.

# v0.5: extended version with more features. May 3, 2015

extended version with config file, http and telnet interfaces, statsd for internal instrumentation, disk spooling support, but still blocking sends

# v0.1: initial release. May 3, 2015

initial, simple version that used commandline args to configure. no admin interfaces
basically the version written by Richard Crowley with some minor patches

note that this version uses blocking sends (1 endpoint down blocks the program)
